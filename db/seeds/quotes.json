The manager of architecture, the manager of control program implementation, and I were threshing out the plan, schedule, and division of responsibilities.  The architecture manager had 10 good men.  He asserted that they could write the specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more than the schedule allowed.  The control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be  well-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if the architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs for ten months.  To this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program team the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would also be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He was right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made the system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it added a year to debugging time.",

If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification might be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express an opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of such machinery impracticable...  And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement, which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the  application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.

        "text": "I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder.  It's a very powerful emotion.  All children feel it.  In a first grade classroom everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost nobody feels it, or at least acknowledges it.  Something happens between first and twelfth grade, and it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach much skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense of wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.  Poor popularizations of science establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.",

But there is a kind of Gresham's Law by which in popular culture the bad science drives out the good.  And for this I think we have to blame, first, the scientific community ourselves for not doing a better job of popularizing science, and second, the media, which are in this respect almost uniformly dreadful.  Every newspaper in America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly astronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational system.  We do not teach how to think.  This is a very serious failure that may even, in a world rigged with 60,000 nuclear weapons, compromise the human future.",

And then I'm asked, Yeah, but what do you really think?  I say, I just told you what I really think.  Yeah, but  what's your gut feeling?  But I try not to think with my gut.

The history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken for a pleasure drug.

Most notably I have ignored the evidence for an Earth that is six thousand years old.  Well, I haven't ignored it; I considered the purported evidence and *then* rejected it. There is a difference, and this is a difference, we might say, between  prejudice and postjudice.  Prejudice is making a judgment before you have looked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.  Prejudice is terrible, in the sense that you commit injustices and you make serious mistakes.  Postjudice is not terrible.  You can't be perfect of course; you may make mistakes also.  But it is permissible to make a judgment after you have examined the evidence.  In some circles it is even encouraged.",
